# Streamlit Discovery and Examples

## Introduction

Welcome to my Streamlit discovery repository! Here, I document my journey exploring Streamlit, a powerful tool for building data apps with Python. This repository contains various examples demonstrating the capabilities of Streamlit.
Visit https://streamlit.io/ for more information

## Getting Started

Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create and share beautiful, custom web apps for machine learning and data science. Follow these instructions to get started:

1. **Install Streamlit**:
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit
    ```

2. **Run a Simple App**:
    ```python
    # hello.py

    st.write("Hello, Streamlit!")
    ```

3. **Run the App**:
    ```bash
    streamlit run hello.py
    ```
